## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 [`ass1`](./ass1)
> **Title**: *Car Fuel Efficiency & Regression Models*

In this assignment, we:
- Explored and visualized the car dataset (`cars.csv`)
- Handled missing values using appropriate imputation methods
- Analyzed fuel economy trends across different countries
- Built regression models:
  - Linear Regression (closed-form & gradient descent)
  - Polynomial Regression
- Visualized relationships using scatter plots and histograms

📎 **Key Techniques**:  
`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`, `scipy`, linear algebra

### 🔹 [`ass2`](./ass2)
> **Title**: *Polynomial & Logistic Regression with Model Evaluation*

This assignment demonstrates:
- Polynomial regression with train/val/test split
- Ridge regression with regularization tuning
- Logistic regression with:
  - Linear decision boundary
  - Quadratic decision boundary (using polynomial features)
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Discussion on overfitting and model generalization

📎 **Key Techniques**:  
`sklearn`, `PolynomialFeatures`, `LogisticRegression`, `MSE`, `visualization`
